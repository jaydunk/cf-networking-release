# CLI
Network policies can be managed using the CF Networking CLI plugin.

## Installation

There are 3 ways to install the plugin.  The easiest way to get started is using option 1.

#### Option 1: Using the Community Plugin Repository

1. Ensure you have a recent version of the CF CLI:

   ```
   cf version
   ```

   Should show version `6.28` or higher.
   If not, update your CF CLI by following the [CLI installation instructions](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).

2. Install the plugin from the [Cloud Foundry Community Plugins Repository](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/):

   ```
   cf install-plugin -r CF-Community network-policy
   ```

#### Option 2: Using a binary release from GitHub

1. Download a precompiled binary of the `network-policy-plugin` for your
   operating system from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/releases)

2. Install the binary

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/Downloads/network-policy-plugin
    cf install-plugin ~/Downloads/network-policy-plugin
    ```

#### Option 3: Building from source

  From the root of this repository, run

  ```bash
  direnv allow
  go build -o /tmp/network-policy-plugin ./src/cli-plugin
  cf install-plugin /tmp/network-policy-plugin
